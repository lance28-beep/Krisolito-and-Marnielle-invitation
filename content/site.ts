  narrative: `Some love stories begin with a spark. Kris and Mynee’s began with faith, friendship, and God’s perfect timing.
Written quietly over the years, their story unfolded through service in Church, seasons of waiting, miles of distance, and moments of choosing love every single day. It is a story shaped by patience, strengthened by sacrifice, and grounded in faith—one that grew not in haste, but in purpose. From shared beginnings as friends, to long travels just to spend a few precious hours together, to finding peace in nature and joy in worship side by side, every chapter has reminded them—and everyone who knows them—that when love is entrusted to God, it always finds its way home.
Krisolito “Kris” Bacus Caliva and Marnielle “Mynee” Antiga Salig first met on October 10, 2016, as college students and co-officers of the NCMC MAS-AMiCUS Executive Committee. Kris was from the North Bukidnon District, while Mynee was from the Iligan City District of MAS-AMiCUS. At that time, Bukidnon was still part of the North Central Mindanao Conference (now, it has become the Central Mindanao Mission (CMM)). Kris served as the NEWSTART Committee Head, while Mynee was the Music Committee Head. It was in the Church, surrounded by service and shared faith, where their story quietly began.Their friendship grew naturally through years of shared ministry, teamwork, conversations, and laughter with fellow officers. Their bond was built on faith, trust, and a love for serving God, and their love was anchored in Christ—a foundation that would guide them through every season of life together.
Years later, during Mynee’s fourth year of college, Kris began pursuing her with sincerity and patience. He courted her faithfully and waited almost two years, trusting God’s timing and choosing love that was intentional and steady. Then, on February 13, 2021, nearly five years after they first met, their friendship blossomed into a relationship they both knew was worth the wait. Just like all who walk in the Lord, their love story was not a walk in the park. They faced trials, challenges, and long seasons of waiting, especially during their years apart. For almost five years, theirs was a long-distance love—Kris living and working in Malaybalay City, Bukidnon, while Mynee lived and worked in Iligan City. Amidst the distance, prayer became their refuge, guiding them through moments of longing and uncertainty. Distance tested their patience, but it never weakened their commitment. Kris would travel two to three hours just to spend time with Mynee, choosing presence over convenience. Despite these challenges, both of them trusted God’s timing for their journey. 
In 2024, the miles between them finally shortened when Mynee moved to work in Cagayan de Oro City—another quiet reminder that God’s plan unfolds perfectly in His time. Amid the waiting and the distance, Kris and Mynee found joy in the simplest moments—picnic dates, nature walks, and time spent under open skies. Both of them cherish dates surrounded by nature, where conversations flow easily and God’s presence feels closest. This shared love for nature is their reason for choosing a wedding solemnized in the midst of  nature.
Then, in the quiet mountains of Kibalabag, Bukidnon, on the calm evening of December 26, 2024, encircled by close friends and the beauty of nature, Kris asked Mynee to walk with him in life as his wife. It was a simple, heartfelt moment—there was no grand setup, no elaborate decorations, just the two of them, with their friends nearby, in the middle of the  tranquil mountains. After four years of courtship, a year of engagement, Kris and Mynee are going back to the same place when Kris knelt for her hand.
This time,  it will be for the purpose of solemnizing their matrimonial vows.
Today, they still lovingly call each other “babi,” “babibuu,” and “love”—simple words carrying years of prayers, patience, miles traveled, and a love faithfully written by God. And now, with grateful hearts, Kris and Mynee step into forever—hand in hand, trusting the Author of their story. `,
